## Warning/Reminder

*The request limit of the Mock API provided for this challenge is used up. It response HTTP status: 429, so I couldn't test the app functionalities extensively. But, I have finished the implementation of the  main app functionalities. As I had to make the blind testing, I want you to understand if there is any issue with the app. And you might need to increase your request limit or create another mock server to test the app.*
